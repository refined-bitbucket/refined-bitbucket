# 3.7.3 (2018-03-08)

From now on, you have the option to disable update notifications that open a new browser tab each time a new version
of the extension is released. The new option is located at the bottom of the Options page.

If you are still interested in getting notified about updates but in a less intrusive way, [subscribe to this issue on
GitHub](https://github.com/refined-bitbucket/refined-bitbucket/issues/182), which will be updated with each release
and you will get an e-mail in your inbox.

### Improvements:

*   Now you can disable update notifications through the Options page,

# 3.7.2 (2018-02-28)

### Bug fixes:

*   The "Don't carry pluses and minuses to clipboard" feature is supposed
    to delete "+" and "-" characters from line diffs, but it was mistakenly
    removing some other characters.
    The previous attempt in pull request #162 at solving issue #161 didn't actually solve it,
    closes [issue #161](https://github.com/refined-bitbucket/refined-bitbucket/issues/161),
    [pull request #165](https://github.com/refined-bitbucket/refined-bitbucket/pull/165).

# 3.7.0 (2018-02-26)

I'm very happy with this release since a bug that existed since the initial release of the extension has been
closed, [issue #63](https://github.com/refined-bitbucket/refined-bitbucket/issues/63). Previously, all lines that
contained word diffs in file diffs were not syntax highlighted! I didn't anticipate how much of a difference fixing this
issue would make, but now that I have been using it for a few days, I can say that it tremendously improves the syntax
highlighting experience. Hope you find it as useful as I have!

Remember to rate the extension in the [Chrome Webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/refined-bitbucket/afppminkfnfngihdocacbgeajbbdklkf)
or [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/refined-bitbucket-/) if you haven't already, it
helps give the extension visibility in the market place and help other users find it!

Oh, and something else, I've wanted to add a proper logo to the extension for a while but I'm not a designer myself. I
had a friend of mine sketch some ideas and posted them here
[#15](https://github.com/refined-bitbucket/refined-bitbucket/issues/15),
if you have some time, would love for you to drop by and leave some feedback!

### Features:

*   Don't carry pluses and minuses to clipboard when copying diff's contents,
    closes [issue #149](https://github.com/refined-bitbucket/refined-bitbucket/issues/149),
    [pull request #156](https://github.com/refined-bitbucket/refined-bitbucket/pull/156).

### Improvement:

*   Word diffs no longer remove or break syntax highlighting.
    closes [issue #63](https://github.com/refined-bitbucket/refined-bitbucket/issues/63),
    [pull request #158](https://github.com/refined-bitbucket/refined-bitbucket/pull/158).

### Bug fixes:

*   The "Close anchor branch" checkbox was being checked even
    in the PR editing screen. It's been fixed now so that it only works
    in the creation screen, like how it should've been all along,
    closes [issue #155](https://github.com/refined-bitbucket/refined-bitbucket/issues/155),
    [pull request #157](https://github.com/refined-bitbucket/refined-bitbucket/pull/157).

### Language support:

*   **Perl**: Expanded Perl support to include Perl test files and template toolkit (\*.t, \*.tt).
    [pull request #148](https://github.com/refined-bitbucket/refined-bitbucket/pull/148).
*   Add Flow and Jest Snapshots syntax highlighting as JSX files (\*.flow, \*.snap).

# 3.6.0 (2018-02-11)

Huge thanks to [@atdrago](http://github.com/atdrago) and [@dpekkle](http://github.com/dpekkle) for helping out with
testing and identifying several issues in this release!

### Features:

    links in the sidebar navigation menu,
    closes [issue #133](https://github.com/refined-bitbucket/refined-bitbucket/issues/133),
    [pull request #134](https://github.com/refined-bitbucket/refined-bitbucket/pull/134).
*   **Source Branch**: Adds the source branch name next to the pull request title in the
    pull request list view and linkifies it along with the target branch,
    closes [issue #135](https://github.com/refined-bitbucket/refined-bitbucket/issues/135),
    [pull request #136](https://github.com/refined-bitbucket/refined-bitbucket/pull/136).

    list view,

    [pull request #142](https://github.com/refined-bitbucket/refined-bitbucket/pull/142).

### Bug fixes:

    while any PR added dynamically to the DOM were not affected,
    closes [issue #138](https://github.com/refined-bitbucket/refined-bitbucket/issues/138),
    [pull request #139](https://github.com/refined-bitbucket/refined-bitbucket/pull/139).

    [pull request #140](https://github.com/refined-bitbucket/refined-bitbucket/pull/140).
*   **Syntax Highlighting**: Syntax highlighting was not working for anyone who installed the
    extension for the first time on version 3.4.0 or 3.5.0, due to the refactoring made
    to the Options mechanism in [pull request #107](https://github.com/refined-bitbucket/refined-bitbucket/pull/107),
    closes [issue #143](https://github.com/refined-bitbucket/refined-bitbucket/issues/143),
    [pull request #146](https://github.com/refined-bitbucket/refined-bitbucket/pull/146).

### Language support:

*   **Header File extension**: Added Header File extension (\*.hpp), commonly used
    for tempalte implementations, or directly as C++ header extension,
    [pull request #132](https://github.com/refined-bitbucket/refined-bitbucket/pull/132).
*   **Perl**: Add support for the Perl module extension (\*.pm),
    [pull request #145](https://github.com/refined-bitbucket/refined-bitbucket/pull/145).
*   Updated PrismJS to v1.11.0 to add new language definitions
    that were not supported in the previous version, like TSX,

    [pull request #124](https://github.com/refined-bitbucket/refined-bitbucket/pull/124).

[pr-templates-bitbucket]: https://bitbucket.org/site/master/issues/11571/custom-pull-request-description-template

*   **Pullrequest Template**: [Available in GitHub since the start of 2016][pr-templates-github],
    and [actively requested by Bitbucket users][pr-templates-bitbucket]. With this feature, by including a
    `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` file in the default branch of the repository in one of the locations below, the contents of
    that file template will replace the default pull request body inserted by Bitbucket when creating a new one.

    ```
    /PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
    /docs/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
    /.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
    /.bitbucket/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
    ```

    Please note that the filename IS case sensitive (must be all caps),
    and MUST have the .md file extension. No other file extensions will be
    recognized. The file to be used will be the first to be found in one
    of these locations (from top to bottom).

    It's also possible to specify a URL for a raw Gist with the contents
    of the template in the options page, in case you don't want to include
    the file in your repository, e.g., https://gist.githubusercontent.com/anonymous/8054a3ee32f7cf1a5975e3fd52b3c5f3/raw/f6897720e8b6b93becd246187dac36038291c3a4/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md.

*   **Close anchor branch**: Check the "Close anchor branch" checkbox by default when creating or editing pull requests,
    closes [issue #92](https://github.com/refined-bitbucket/refined-bitbucket/issues/92),
    [pull request #110](https://github.com/refined-bitbucket/refined-bitbucket/pull/110).

    *   Diffs removal

### Development:

    modules,
    [pull request #104](https://github.com/refined-bitbucket/refined-bitbucket/pull/104).
*   Removed the `extension` folder from source control and moved everything to `src` for better code colocation.
    Now using webpack to copy all the necessary resources,

    [pull request #107](https://github.com/refined-bitbucket/refined-bitbucket/pull/107).

# 3.3.0 (2018-01-09)

With the release of [Firefox Quantum](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) there is a renewed interest for this
browser in the community, so we have decided to officially publish the extension as an
[Add-on for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/refined-bitbucket-/)! I'd like to thank
[@Ivan0xFF](https://github.com/Ivan0xFF) with [#40](https://github.com/refined-bitbucket/refined-bitbucket/pull/40) and
[@awendland](https://github.com/awendland) with [#89](https://github.com/refined-bitbucket/refined-bitbucket/issues/89)
for getting the wheel moving in this direction.

If you decide to switch to Firefox and use this extension, let me know of any compatibily issues if they arise!
Also, if you find it useful, don't forget to rate it so that other users can find it!

### Features:

*   **Collapse-diff**: A button to toggle the diff text was added at the bottom of the diff. Additionally, clicking this
    or the previous button at the top will now scroll the diff into view at the top of the page,
    closes [issue #88](https://github.com/refined-bitbucket/refined-bitbucket/issues/88),
    [pull request #95](https://github.com/refined-bitbucket/refined-bitbucket/pull/95).

### Improvements:

*   **Collapse-diff**: Test suite for the feature,
    [pull request #94](https://github.com/refined-bitbucket/refined-bitbucket/pull/94).
*   **Syntax-highlighting**: Fix for an issue where the styling necessary for syntax highlighting pull requests was
    interfering with some of Bitbucket's own styling, which caused inline code in comments to have a white background
    instead of their original gray background,
    closes [issue #74](https://github.com/refined-bitbucket/refined-bitbucket/issues/74) and
    [issue #93](https://github.com/refined-bitbucket/refined-bitbucket/issues/93),
    [pull request #99](https://github.com/refined-bitbucket/refined-bitbucket/pull/99).

### Language support:

*   Replaced `.js` syntax-highlighting styles from pure Javascript (`language-javascript`) to JSX (`language-jsx`).
    Highlighting should be exactly the same, except for JSX markup which will now be properly highlighted,
    [pull request #100](https://github.com/refined-bitbucket/refined-bitbucket/pull/100).

# 3.2.0 (2017-12-13)

[dms]: https://bitbucket.org/site/master/issues/13895/default-merge-strategy

The highlight of this release is the feature "Default merge strategy".
[As you can see, this has been a popular request by Bitbucket users for almost a year now][dms],
but now I hope this can serve as a solution for most of the people who voted on that official issue.

### Features:

*   **Default-merge-strategy**: Choose either "Merge commit" or "Squash" as the default merge strategy for pull requests
    in the Options page,
    closes [issue #90](https://github.com/refined-bitbucket/refined-bitbucket/issues/90),

# 3.0.0 (2017-11-03)

After a long time of active development being dormant on this project, we are coming back with what I consider some
great new features and improvements. Because of this, we are bumping to a new major release, v3.0.0!
Check out the updated README to see some screenshots and gifs

The development environment for the extension was greatly improved as well, with changes that will make adding and
testing new features a lot easier. We are hoping that future releases can come by quicker from now on.

If you stumble upon any weird behavior or bugs, please report an issue, I'll be be more than happy to tackle them as
soon as I can. If you can have any quick question, you can hit me up on Twitter
[@reyronald](http://www.twitter.com/reyronald).
