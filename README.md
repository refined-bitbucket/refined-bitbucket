# refined-bitbucket
We all know BitBucket lacks some features that we have in other platforms like GitHub, GitLab and others. Originally inspired on Sindre Sorhus' [Refined Github](https://github.com/sindresorhus/refined-github) extension, _refined-bitbucket_ is born as a collaborative project by a few developers to improve upon those holes, and even add some additional functionality that will enhance the overall user experience.

## Current features
- Adds syntax highlighting for pull requests. [See the full list of enabled languages](https://github.com/refined-bitbucket/refined-bitbucket/blob/dev/src/syntax-highlight/language-ext.js). Missing any language? [Let me know](https://github.com/refined-bitbucket/refined-bitbucket/issues) or submit a pull request!
- Double click on a word to highlight all occurrences.
- ~~Block pull request merging without a minimum number of approvals (defaults to 2 minimum approvals).~~ Removed. [Implemented natively by Bitbucket with "merge checks"](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/checks-for-merging-pull-requests-776640039.html)
- Key binding feature, which allows for quicker navigation through pull requests.
- Button to collapse diffs in Pull Request view.
- Autocollapse:
  - Add filename patterns in the Options page that you would like the extension to collapse automatically when the pull request loads.
  - Deleted files are automatically collapsed.
- Pullrequest Ignore. Add filename patterns in the Options page that you would like the extension to completely remove when the Pull Request loads.
- Button to load all failed diffs in Pull Request view.
- Choose a default merge strategy for your pull requests.

## Can I use this on Bitbucket Server?

Sadly, no :(. Although Bitbucket Server and Bitbucket Cloud share a similar name, both are actually two completely different products. [Read this comment for a more detailed explanation](https://github.com/refined-bitbucket/refined-bitbucket/issues/39#issuecomment-338455398).

## Compiling & Contributing

Contributions are very appreciated! Even if you can't contribute with a pull request, if you stumble upon any weird behavior or bugs, let us know with an issue!

If you want to run a development version of the extension, clone the repo and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run watch
```

This will watch any changes in the `src` folder and compile them to the `extension` folder. To test in Chrome, activate the Developer mode in `chrome://extensions`, click "Load unpacked extension..." and browse to that folder.

If you're new to Chrome extension development, take some time to read Google's [documentation on extensions](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions).

#### Integration

There is a test suite included. Before sending a pull request please make
sure all tests are passing by running:

```bash
npm test
```
